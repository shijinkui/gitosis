gitosis (0.2+20080825-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Daniel Baumann ]
  * Updating vcs fields in control file.
  * Adjusting hash in README.Debian to reflect that you don't need to be root to
    do the initial sudo call in order to initialize the gitosis-admin
    repository. However, you need to have sudo access to execute commands on
    behalf of the gitosis system user (which practically implies root privileges
    anyway).
  * Adding upstream location to copyright file.
  * Using patch-stamp rather than patch in rules file.

  [ Thomas Viehmann ]
  * Remove easy-install.pth, setuptools.pth in debian/rules install and leave
    that to packages providing the modules (Closes: #498209).
  * Remove generated stuff in debian/rules clean.

gitosis (0.2+20080319-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Up to now, gitosis was using /var/cache/git to store its repositories. The
    reason for this was that by using the same directory as git-daemon itself,
    there was no need to adjust the configuration of git-daemon to make the
    git repositories available (read-only) through the git protocol publically.
    By moving them to /var/cache/gitosis, you need to reconfigure your
    git-daemon to export also repositories in this directory, otherwise the
    repositories are not accessible for anyone except those which are configured
    in gitosis-admin (Closes: #472343, #473574).
  * Using versioned depends against git-core for etch-backports compatibility
    (Closes: #473908).
  * Re-adding python-setuptools to depends (Closes: #473022).
